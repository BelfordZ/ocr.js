ocr.js
======

Optical Character Recognition Implemented Using Javascript (mostly). In its current state, it does nothing impressive at all. I need to put in some time to clean things up. It uses Brain.js, a neural network javascript lib, as my method of classification. As feature extraction methods, at this point all the tools are in place to do what ever your mind conjures. I use ascii chars rendered onto the canvas, then do pixel manipulation to get bounding boxes, contours, what ever you need. If you are interested in working with this project, shoot me an email belfordz at gmail
