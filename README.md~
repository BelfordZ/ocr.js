ocr.js
======

Optical Character Recognition Implemented Using Javascript (mostly). In its current state, it does nothing impressive at all. I need to put in some time to clean things up. It uses Brain.js, a neural network javascript lib, as my method of classification. As feature extraction methods, at this point all the tools are in place to do what ever your mind conjures. I use ascii chars rendered onto the canvas, then do pixel manipulation to get bounding boxes, contours, what ever you need.
